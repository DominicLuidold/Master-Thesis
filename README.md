# Master's Thesis
This repository contains both the LaTeX file as well as the implementation of the [*EthicsVision* platform](https://github.com/DominicLuidold/ethics-vision) which are the core of my master's thesis.

## Abstract

**Practical Application of the User-Centered Design Principles: Redesigning the Ethics Application Tool of the Research Ethics Commission of Vorarlberg University of Applied Sciences**

The Word application template currently used to create and submit ethics applications for the Research Ethics Commission at Vorarlberg University of Applied Sciences no longer meets the requirements and wishes of the users. In addition to technical limitations, the limited possibilities are the main reason why a software solution was developed on the basis of the principles and the four phases of user-centered design, which should be able to replace the existing system in the long term. The individual chapters of this thesis each correspond to one of the four phases and represent a fully completed iteration of the process.

The analysis of the user contexts carried out is based on a review of the criteria of research ethics and, above all, a detailed analysis of the existing system and processes of the system in use. In addition to the functioning and content structure, the strengths and weaknesses are explained in the course of this. A broad analysis of other systems and processes of ethics committees within Austria is also carried out in order to establish the state of the art.

The subsequent definition of concrete requirements is based on the implementation of a qualitative content analysis of the interviews conducted according to Kuckartz. A total of nine requirements can be defined, which were prioritised and, for the most part, implemented in the developed *EthicsVision* platform. Docker as well as the Symfony framework and the Angular platform are used.

The final evaluation of the prototype is based on feedback from from applicants and the Research Ethics Commission. The proof of concept is perceived as a good foundation, while various possibilities for further development can already be identified. The aim of the work, to accomplish the redevelopment of the ethics application tool, was achieved and a way forward for the future design of the process could be shown.
